// skill-context.mjs — load a skill's full authoring context for autogen.
//
// A SKILL.md is only half the skill: its reference files (Markdown and YAML)
// carry the error tables, command catalogs, constraint specs, and Azure-specific
// detail that candidate tests should be grounded in. Those references live in one
// of two layouts, so this loader discovers BOTH:
//   - sibling files next to SKILL.md (e.g. aks-cost-optimization/azure-aks-*.md)
//   - a references/ subdirectory   (e.g. aks-automatic-readiness/references/*.yaml)
// The bundle feeds the *generation* step (scaffold-eval.mjs).
//
// NOTE: the gate (baseline-gate.mjs) scores candidates against SKILL.md ONLY,
// to match the eval harness (evals/providers/skill-provider.js). A candidate
// that truly depends on a reference is therefore dropped by the gate — correct,
// since it would also fail in promptfoo until the provider loads references.
//
// A hard character budget keeps a large reference set from blowing up cost. The
// bundle is assembled file-by-file so `files` is an EXACT manifest of what was
// actually included; anything dropped for budget is reported in `omitted` rather
// than silently sliced mid-file (which would make the manifest lie).
