# AKS GPU & Inference (Day-2)

Operate and troubleshoot GPU and model-serving workloads on AKS after they exist. This is the failure → check → fix loop, not a setup guide — for enabling GPUs, KAITO, or a model runway, use `azure-skills airunway-aks-setup`.

## Operating rules

- **Read-only by default.** Diagnose and propose; do not scale, cordon, delete node pools, or delete KAITO Workspaces unless the user explicitly asks — deleting a Workspace has a cost trap (below).
- **Evidence before conclusion.** GPU symptoms have layered causes (quota → capacity → scheduling → driver). Quote the event, node capacity, or condition that supports the root cause.

## The four walls (check in this order)

Most "my GPU workload won't run" incidents are one of these, and they stack — clearing one exposes the next:

1. **GPU quota is 0 by default.** Every N-series VM family starts at **0 vCPUs in every region**, and quota is measured in **vCPUs, not GPUs**. Check: `az vm list-usage --location <region> -o table` and look for the family row (e.g. `Standard NC Family vCPUs`, `Standard NCADSA100v4 Family vCPUs`). Error signature: *"Insufficient vCPU quota for Standard NCASv3_T4 Family…"*.
2. **Quota ≠ capacity ≠ SKU-eligibility.** Even with quota, a region/zone can lack physical GPU capacity, and AKS gates some GPU SKUs behind a separate eligibility ticket. Check what's actually creatable: `az vm list-skus --location <region> --resource-type virtualMachines -o table`.
3. **The taint/toleration/nodeSelector triad.** GPU pools use the convention taint `sku=gpu:NoSchedule`. A GPU pod must carry the matching toleration (`key=sku, value=gpu, effect=NoSchedule`), request `nvidia.com/gpu: 1`, and (by convention) select `accelerator: nvidia`. A missing toleration is the most common Pending cause after quota.
4. **No `nvidia.com/gpu` advertised on the node** → a driver / device-plugin model mismatch. See the driver decision matrix in [references/gpu-scheduling.md](references/gpu-scheduling.md).

## Symptom → reference

| Symptom | Reference |
|---------|-----------|
| Pod Pending "Insufficient nvidia.com/gpu"; taints/quota/scheduling; driver models; `--gpu-driver` | [references/gpu-scheduling.md](references/gpu-scheduling.md) |
| KAITO Workspace never becomes ready; conditions; the delete-doesn't-delete-the-pool cost trap | [references/kaito-workspaces.md](references/kaito-workspaces.md) |
| Idle GPU cost, scale-to-zero, spot eviction, SKU-to-model right-sizing, KEDA on GPU | [references/gpu-cost-and-scaling.md](references/gpu-cost-and-scaling.md) |
| GPU utilization/VRAM metrics, DCGM, OOMKilled on weight load | [references/gpu-observability.md](references/gpu-observability.md) |

## Fast triage

```bash
# Are GPUs schedulable? (capacity/allocatable nvidia.com/gpu + the accelerator label)
kubectl describe node <gpu-node> | grep -EA6 "Labels:|Capacity:|Allocatable:"
kubectl get nodes -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,GPU:.status.allocatable.'nvidia\.com/gpu'

# Why is a GPU pod Pending?
kubectl describe pod <pod> | grep -A15 Events

# Is the driver/device-plugin stack present?
kubectl get pods -A -o wide | grep -Ei "nvidia|device-plugin|dcgm"
az aks nodepool show -g <rg> --cluster-name <cluster> -n <pool> --query gpuProfile

# GPU vCPU quota by family (the exact "Insufficient vCPU quota" check)
az vm list-usage --location "<region>" -o table | grep -Ei "Total Regional|NC|ND"
```

## Two facts that break copy-pasted commands

- **DCGM metrics port differs by install model.** AKS-**managed** GPU pools expose the DCGM exporter on **port 19400**; NVIDIA upstream / GPU-Operator use **9400**. A `curl localhost:9400/metrics` against a managed pool returns nothing.
- **Kubernetes has no GPU-memory-pressure signal.** VRAM exhaustion surfaces only as a container **OOMKilled (exit 137)** — *after* DCGM (`DCGM_FI_DEV_FB_USED`/`FB_FREE`) already shows the trend. Size the SKU to the model up front.
