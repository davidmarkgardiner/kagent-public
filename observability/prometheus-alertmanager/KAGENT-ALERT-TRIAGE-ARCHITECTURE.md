## What This Diagram Shows

This is an extension of the original Prometheus alerting pipeline. The original pipeline routes alerts from Prometheus through AlertManager into Argo Events, which triggers a workflow that creates GitLab issues and sends Mattermost notifications.

The enhanced version adds an **AI triage layer** between the Argo Workflow and the reporting outputs. Instead of just forwarding raw alerts, the workflow now calls KAgent to analyse the alert using LLM-powered agents before creating issues and notifications.

## Pipeline Flow (7 Steps)

### Step 1: COLLECT — Scrape & Evaluate

| Component | Namespace | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Pods / Containers** | various | Application workloads exposing `/metrics` endpoints |
| **PrometheusRule CRDs** | `monitoring` | Custom alert rules (OOMKilled, PodHighRestarts, FailedScheduling, CPU/Memory/PVC thresholds) |
| **Prometheus** | `monitoring` | Scrapes metrics from pods, evaluates PrometheusRule CRDs to determine if alerts should fire |
| **Grafana** | `monitoring` | Queries Prometheus as a datasource for dashboard visualisation |

### Step 2: ALERT — Webhook to Argo

| Component | Namespace | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **AlertManager** | `monitoring` | Receives firing alerts from Prometheus. The `argo-events-webhook` receiver routes matching alerts via HTTP POST to the EventSource |
| **EventSource** | `argo-events` | Webhook listener on port `12000`, endpoint `/alerts`. Receives AlertManager POST payloads |

### Step 3: TRIAGE — Filter & Trigger

| Component | Namespace | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **EventBus (NATS)** | `argo-events` | Message bus connecting EventSource to Sensor. EventSource publishes alert events, Sensor subscribes |
| **Sensor** | `argo-events` | Filters for `status: firing` alerts, rate-limited to 5/minute. Triggers the `kagent-sre-workflow` WorkflowTemplate |
| **WorkflowTemplate** | `argo-events` | `kagent-sre-workflow` — DAG workflow that orchestrates KAgent triage, GitLab issue creation, and Mattermost notification |

### Step 4: AI TRIAGE — KAgent A2A Call

| Component | Namespace | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **KAgent Controller** | `kagent` | Receives A2A (Agent-to-Agent) HTTP requests from the workflow. Routes to the appropriate agent based on the alert type and mode (triage or remediation) |
| **sre-triage-agent** | `kagent` | **Read-only** agent. Analyses the alert, checks pod status, logs, and events. Produces a root cause analysis without making any changes |
| **sre-remediation-agent** | `kagent` | **Read-write** agent. Can take corrective action (restart pods, scale deployments, patch resources) based on the triage analysis |

The workflow calls the KAgent controller via the A2A protocol:
```
POST /api/a2a/kagent/{agent-name}/
Method: message/send
```

### Step 5: INVESTIGATE — Agents + MCP Tools

| Component | Namespace | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **AKS-MCP** | `kagent` | MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool server providing Kubernetes tools (`kubectl`, `helm`) to the agents. Both triage and remediation agents use AKS-MCP to inspect or modify cluster resources |
| **AKS Cluster** | external | The target workload cluster. AKS-MCP connects to the cluster's Kubernetes API server to execute commands on behalf of the agents |

### Step 6: LLM — Model Inference

| Component | Location | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **agentgateway Gateway** | in-cluster | LLM routing proxy. Agents send inference requests here, and agentgateway forwards to the configured backend |
| **KubeAI (Qwen3-14b)** | self-hosted | Open-source LLM running on the cluster via KubeAI. Model: `qwen3-14b`. No external API calls, full data privacy. Referred to as `openai/qwen3-14b` in agentgateway routing config |
| **OpenAI API (GPT-4o)** | cloud | Alternative cloud-hosted LLM backend. Higher capability but requires external API access and incurs per-token costs |

agentgateway can route to **either** backend. The `OR` relationship means you configure one or both — KubeAI for self-hosted/private workloads, OpenAI for higher-quality analysis when needed.

### Step 7: REPORT — GitLab + Mattermost

| Component | Location | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **GitLab** | external API | Creates an issue containing: alert summary, KAgent triage analysis, root cause, recommended actions, pod logs/events |
| **Mattermost** | `mattermost` namespace | Sends colour-coded webhook notification with alert details, KAgent analysis summary, and a link to the GitLab issue |

## Key Design Decisions

### Two-Agent Pattern (Triage vs Remediation)

- **sre-triage-agent** is read-only — it can inspect pods, logs, events, and describe resources but cannot modify anything. Safe for automated triggering on every alert.
- **sre-remediation-agent** is read-write — it can restart pods, scale deployments, apply patches. Should only be invoked after triage confirms the issue and a remediation path.

This separation ensures that automated alerts don't accidentally trigger destructive actions.

### agentgateway as LLM Gateway

agentgateway sits between the agents and the actual LLM backends. This provides:
- **Model routing** — switch between self-hosted Qwen3-14b and cloud GPT-4o without changing agent config
- **Fallback** — if the self-hosted model is overloaded, requests can fall back to OpenAI
- **Cost tracking** — agentgateway tracks token usage per model
- **API compatibility** — both KubeAI and OpenAI expose OpenAI-compatible APIs, so agents use a single interface

### AKS-MCP for Kubernetes Access

Agents don't run `kubectl` directly. Instead, they call AKS-MCP via the Model Context Protocol, which provides structured Kubernetes tools (`call_kubectl`, `call_helm`). This:
- Avoids shell quoting issues that plague direct kubectl execution
- Provides structured input/output rather than raw shell text
- Enables access control at the MCP server level
